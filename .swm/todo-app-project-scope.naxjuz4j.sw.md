title: Todo App Project Scope
---
## Introduction

This document outlines the scope of a Todo App designed to offer a streamlined and efficient task management experience to users. The goal is to create an app that balances simplicity with functionality, enabling users to organize their tasks effectively.

## Core Features

### Task Management

- **Functionality**: Users should be able to easily create, view, update, and delete tasks. Each task will have essential attributes such as a title, description, due date, and priority level.

### Categories/Tags

- **Organization**: Provide users the ability to categorize or tag tasks, facilitating efficient sorting and retrieval based on themes or priorities.

## User Interface

- **Design Principle**: Adopt a minimalist design that emphasizes usability and easy navigation. The interface should be clean, with a focus on functionality.

## Data Management

- **Local Storage**: By default, all tasks and user preferences will be stored locally on the device.

- **Cloud Syncing** *(Optional)*: Consider offering an option for users to sync their data across devices via a cloud service, enhancing accessibility and data security.

## User Accounts and Settings

- **Cloud Syncing Users**: If implementing cloud syncing, include user account creation and management. Allow users to log in to access and synchronize their tasks across multiple devices.

- **Personalization Options**: Offer customization options, such as themes and notification preferences, allowing users to tailor the app to their liking.

## Security

- **Data Protection**: Ensure the app adheres to best practices in data security, especially if implementing cloud syncing. User data should be encrypted and handled with utmost care.

## Performance and Scalability

- **Efficiency**: The app must be optimized for quick loading times and smooth performance across a wide range of devices, even with a large volume of tasks.

## Exclusions

To maintain focus and simplicity, the initial version of the app will not include:

- Complex task dependencies (e.g., task chaining).

- In-depth productivity analytics.

- Integration with external services, such as calendars or third-party apps.

## Development and Deployment

### Platform Choice

The app will be developed as a web application. This decision streamlines development and focuses on delivering a responsive and accessible product across different devices via web browsers.

## Technology Stack

### Backend

- **Express.js and Node.js**: The backend will be built using Express.js, a web application framework for Node.js. This combination is chosen for its simplicity, performance, and the extensive support it offers for web server development.

### Frontend

- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript templates)**: EJS will be used as the templating engine to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. It offers an easy way to create server-rendered pages with dynamic content, reducing the complexity of frontend development.

### Database

- **SQLite**: For data storage, SQLite is selected for its lightweight nature, requiring minimal setup and running directly within the app. This database is ideal for applications with moderate database needs and simplifies development without sacrificing performance.

## Testing

The testing strategy will focus on ensuring the app's reliability, performance, and usability through:

- **Unit Testing**: Testing individual modules or components for correctness. Tools like Mocha or Jest can be used in combination with assertion libraries to validate the logic.
